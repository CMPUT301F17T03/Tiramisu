###How to select a event (by searching in history or other)

Answer from Di Zhang: 
Not sure what you meant by select. If you want to view details of a event, you can go to the home screen, then tap on the toggle button on the top. It will bring up all events. Then tap on a event to view details. Again, this is just my very first draft UI design, it can be changed and discussed during group meetings.
